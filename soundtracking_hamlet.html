  <h2>Soundtracking Choices - <i>One Piece</i> Adaptation of <i>Hamlet</i> - <a href="https://acdragonheart.github.io/san-francisco-neighborhood-profiles/soundtracking_hamlet.html" target="_blank">External website display</a></h2>
  <p class="indent">Yoshihisa Hirano is the first composer to call for this production because of the beautiful pieces he has made for other projects such as much of the Death Note original soundtrack and compositions such as “The Kingdom of the Predators” from the Hunter x Hunter Soundtrack Volume 3 create the thrilling, somewhat sinister, and unnerving vibes of Imu and his plot.</p>

  <p>The madness hidden within the music and the immaculate productions reflecting the conflicts and resonating with audiences he produced for Death Note are the kinds of domineering and powerful compositions that encapsulate the story's darker themes.</p>

<div class="sawanoTanaka">
  <p class="indent">Hiroyuki Sawano and Kohei Tanaka are also wonderful composers for the other parts of the soundtrack, such as those for Joyboy and his crew. Sawano’s works are very action-packed, especially those from the Attack on Titan soundtrack, which is needed for the conflict scenes between Joyboy and Imu.</p>
  <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5IzZpz0vA73IIjqFPpXSXP?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
  <p>Kohei Tanaka creates more upbeat music, which is perfect for Joyboy’s scenes. Kohei Tanaka has already been employed to create the One Piece: Wano Kuni arc soundtrack, so his pieces will be an anchor to the original IP, while Hiroyuki Sawano is expanding the tonal range of the story, adding caprice to the soundtrack and creating a captivating viewing experience in the process.</p>
  <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6cufjZzevc6spKggsuDEJv?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
  <p>This capriciousness reinforces the madness, becoming more and more deranged over time, and raises the stakes in dire circumstances. It also can build morale and plant the idea that “everything will be alright,” only to reveal the fated devastation wrought by greed and revenge.</p>
