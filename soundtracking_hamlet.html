  <h2>Soundtracking Choices - <a href="https://acdragonheart.github.io/san-francisco-neighborhood-profiles/soundtracking_hamlet.html" target="_blank">External website display</a></h2>
  <p class="indent">Yoshihisa Hirano is the first composer to call for this production because of the beautiful pieces he has made for other projects such as much of the Death Note original soundtrack and compositions such as “The Kingdom of the Predators” from the Hunter x Hunter Soundtrack Volume 3 create the thrilling, somewhat sinister, and unnerving vibes of Imu and his plot.</p>

  <p>The madness hidden within the music and the immaculate productions reflecting the conflicts and resonating with audiences he produced for Death Note are the kinds of domineering and powerful compositions that encapsulate the story's darker themes.</p>

<div class="sawanoTanaka">
  <p class="indent">Hiroyuki Sawano and Kohei Tanaka are also wonderful composers for the other parts of the soundtrack, such as those for Joyboy and his crew. Sawano’s works are very action-packed, especially those from the Attack on Titan soundtrack, which is needed for the conflict scenes between Joyboy and Imu.</p>
  <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5IzZpz0vA73IIjqFPpXSXP?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
  <p>Kohei Tanaka creates more upbeat music, which is perfect for Joyboy’s scenes. Kohei Tanaka has already been employed to create the One Piece: Wano Kuni arc soundtrack, so his pieces will be an anchor to the original IP, while Hiroyuki Sawano is expanding the tonal range of the story, adding caprice to the soundtrack and creating a captivating viewing experience in the process.</p>
  <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6cufjZzevc6spKggsuDEJv?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
  <p>This capriciousness reinforces the madness, becoming more and more deranged over time, and raises the stakes in dire circumstances. It also can build morale and plant the idea that “everything will be alright,” only to reveal the fated devastation wrought by greed and revenge.</p>

  <h2>Possible Main Character Castings - <a href="https://acdragonheart.github.io/san-francisco-neighborhood-profiles/soundtracking_hamlet.html" target="_blank">External website display</a></h2>
  <p class="indent">Casting is crucial for ensuring a good viewing experience, so here is a list of some phenomenal voice actors who would fit the characters incredibly well, starting with Yuichi Nakamura as Joyboy.</p>
  <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmIzYjYxMWUtMzZhYy00MjQwLTg0MWQtNzUxZWI2ZTE4MDg4XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg" width="100%" height="573" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
  <p>Yuichi Nakamura is a great choice because of his relaxed and somewhat arrogant tone; embodying the freedom that Joyboy yearns for. Here is a sample of his previous work:</p>
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BZmAQe7jSh0?si=0rVxvdVLCnhCbWsN" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <p class="indent">As for Joyboy's father, Dawnfell, Akira Kamiya portrays an old and wise tone, fitting of a character bearing the name of the Yoruba god of the sky.</p>
  <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGZkM2UyNTItM2IzZS00MWNiLWI3M2YtNGRmYTZiOTRhY2RkXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg" width="100%" height="1551" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s9AN2bRk9ns?si=u6NSqjacVf9j5Hb3" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <p class="indent">Erebus is a very sinister character, taken over by greed and the most corrupt out of the cast, deciding to dethrone and murder his own brother for power. As a result, the voice actor of Perfect Cell in the <i>Dragon Ball</i> series, combining arrogance with a deep-seeded, yet casual, contempt, is perfect.
  <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzg1ZjU1ZDgtNWI2OC00Mjk2LWE2OWItMTkxYjRlZWEyYzU5XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg" width="100%" height="450" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_lzG9MnkVlA?si=xIrfKdrR8HCeiYXq" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <p class="indent">Imu is a dark, mysterious figure, who is more often reserved but will lash out with the right catalyst. Kôki Uchiyama emulates this facade of cold, and emotionless, reason while still having the range to portray the outbursts of Imu. His voice is also suited for displaying the annoyance and irritation that would come from having to reason with a careless figure like Joyboy.</p>
  <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTYwNGIzYmQtYzBkOC00YTE3LTljZGQtNzdlMjAzZDM2OGU4XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg" width="100%" height="930" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PdEY0Eua_Ko?si=e8pMKqDxshFT3B-c" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <p class="indent">Lili is the last of the main cast, and her voice actor, Miyuki Sawashiro, is renowned for her more serious role of Kurapika in <i>Hunter x Hunter</i>.</p>
  <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGQ2Y2ExM2UtMzc3YS00ODI4LWI4NGItOTlhNDFjMWM0MzQxXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg" width="100%" height="558" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
  <p>Sawashiro has a less comical voice, similar to that of Imu, which builds the connection between the characters, but also reinforces Imu's attachment and perception that she is perfect for him and does not match with Joyboy's attitude. This tone also reflects the important role of Lili within the story.</p>
